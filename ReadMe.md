DSA Project: Dijkstra’s Algorithm
	Build a program that takes a graph, starting location, and end location as input and gives the shortest path as output.

The Program should be able to:
1)	Take any graph as input
2)	Heapify Graph (min Heap)
•	With Heap Operations
3)	Implement Priority Queue
•	With Priority based on distance
4)	Find the shortest path between two points on a graph using Heaps and Deque
5)	Save Graphs to file.
6)	Load Graphs from file
7)	Be Able to Edit Graphs
Tasks:
-	File Operations (Amr Edris)
-	Implement Graphs (Mourad Elshorbagy)
-	Ability to edit graphs (Amr Edris & Mourad Elshorbagy)
-	Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Zeyad Sameh & Mourad Elshorbagy)
-	Implement Heaps and Associated Fns (Youssef Haytham)
